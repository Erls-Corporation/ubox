ubox is an overlay image viewer (It's a kind of lightbox) jQuery plug-in.
I developed it to use on my Uygulama project. 
Mostly lightbox scripts can't handle smart phone/iphone's small screen sizes but this can. 
I've tested it on my iphone it works.

I've only tested it on 
 * Google Chrome (11.0.696.65), 
 * Chromium (11.0.696.71 (86024) Ubuntu 11.04), 
 * Mozilla Firefox (4.0.1), 
 * Opera (11.10 (2092)) 
and it works enough for me for now!
